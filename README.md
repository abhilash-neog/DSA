# DSA
DSA is a repository of programs written in C, which includes implementation of data structures and algorithms.

#Usage

The files can be runned from an IDE(Eg. CodeBlocks).
For running on the terminal, the following commands would be useful:

->gcc -c filename.c (to create the compiled file - filename.o)

->gcc -o exe filename.o

To execute multiole files together(linking):

->gcc -o exe file1.o file2.o

A shorter way:

->gcc file1.c file2.c 

->./a.out  (a.out is the exe file produced on first command)
